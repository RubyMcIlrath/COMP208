                                <p>My teaching philosophy is rooted in the belief that every student has the potential to succeed. I strive to create a learning environment that is inclusive, supportive, and engaging, where students feel empowered to explore and grow.</p>

                                <p>Who am I as a learner? After 13 years of education, I've learned that my most effective learning comes from being inspired by those around me and the environment I'm in. The influence of my friends, family, and teachers has been crucial in shaping my study habits. I thrive when surrounded by passionate and enthusiastic individuals who love what they do. This inspiration fuels my own learning and drives me to engage more deeply with the material.</p>

                                <p>I've found that I learn best through visual and hands-on approaches, which help me fully understand how things work in our world. This learning style was particularly beneficial in Design Technology (DT) during high school, where the hands-on, collaborative nature of the subject allowed me to excel. My confidence grew in areas I enjoyed, thanks to teachers who were deeply passionate about their subjects. Their enthusiasm and encouragement pushed me to do my best and made me feel accomplished.</p>

                                <p>I am motivated by the energy and passion of my teachers and peers. If I find myself in a dull or uninspiring environment, my performance suffers. Conversely, a teacher who genuinely enjoys their subject and understands it deeply can significantly impact how well I learn. This insight became particularly clear to me during my final years of high school.</p>

                                <p>Bronfenbrenner's Bioecological Model of Development illustrates how the environments we are immersed in influence our learning. "We develop as ecosystems because they are constantly interacting with and influencing each other" (Margetts, 2019, p. 56). The ecosystems in which I've grown up have played a significant role in shaping my educational experiences and my identity as a learner. My microsystem, which includes my immediate family, has been particularly influential. My father, a tradesman, has always ensured that I understand the complete process of design and its functionality. His influence, stemming from my early fascination with building designs, has shaped how I grasp and appreciate how things work.</p>
