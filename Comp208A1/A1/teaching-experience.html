                                    <h2>My Teaching Experience</h2>
                                </header>
                                <p>Throughout my three years at university, I have had the invaluable opportunity to complete teaching placements at a variety of schools, each offering unique environments and challenges. My experience spans a public co-educational school, an all-boys single-sex Catholic private school, and a co-educational selective school that consistently ranks in the top 20 for the Higher School Certificate (HSC) each year.</p>
                                <p>These placements have provided me with a broad perspective on different educational settings, allowing me to adapt my teaching strategies to suit diverse student needs and institutional cultures. In the public co-ed school, I gained experience working with a mixed-gender student population, addressing varied learning styles, and managing a dynamic classroom environment. At the all-boys Catholic school, I honed my ability to engage students in a single-sex setting, focusing on building rapport and encouraging academic excellence within a structured framework. Lastly, at the selective school, I developed techniques to challenge high-achieving students, helping them to reach their full potential in a highly competitive academic setting.</p>
                                <p>These diverse experiences have equipped me with the skills to create inclusive, engaging, and effective learning experiences for all students, regardless of their background or academic level.</p>
                                <p>Below are the links to the schools where I was fortunate to complete three-week placements during my university studies. These experiences provided me with the opportunity to engage with a diverse range of TAS teachers, each bringing their own unique set of skills and teaching techniques to the classroom. During these placements, I observed firsthand how different teaching approaches are tailored to specific subjects within the TAS department, allowing me to broaden my understanding of how to effectively deliver content across various disciplines</p>
                                <p>As TAS encompasses a wide array of subjects, I discovered that each teacher typically specializes in certain areas rather than covering the entire spectrum. This specialization allowed me to learn from experts in fields such as Design and Technology, Engineering Studies, Information and Software Technology, and Food Technology, among others. By interacting with these experienced educators, I gained valuable insights into the nuances of teaching these subjects, as well as strategies for engaging students and fostering a deep understanding of the material.</p>
                                <p>These placements were instrumental in shaping my approach to teaching, as they highlighted the importance of adaptability, collaboration, and continuous learning in the ever-evolving landscape of education. The skills and knowledge I acquired during these experiences have greatly influenced my teaching philosophy and continue to guide my practice as I strive to create meaningful and impactful learning experiences for my students.</p>
