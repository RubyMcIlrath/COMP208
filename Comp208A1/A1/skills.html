                                                <p>The study of Food Technology provides students with a broad knowledge of food properties, processing, preparation, nutritional considerations and consumption patterns. It addresses the importance of hygiene and safe working practices and legislation in relation to the production of food. Students develop food-specific skills, which can be applied in a range of contexts enabling students to produce quality food products. The course also provides students with contexts through which to explore the richness, pleasure and variety food adds to life and how it contributes to both vocational and general life experiences.

They explore fabrics, yarns, fibres and colouration. Students examine the historical, cultural and contemporary perspectives on textile design and develop an appreciation of the factors affecting them as textile consumers. Students investigate the work of textile designers and make judgements about the appropriateness of design ideas, the selection of materials and tools, and the quality of textile items. Textile projects allow students to be creative, independent learners and to explore functional and aesthetic aspects of textiles.
